# DSA Practice

This repository contains my solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms problems.  
I use it to practice coding, improve problem-solving skills, and track my progress over time.

## Structure
The problems are grouped by topic (arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.).  
Each file contains the solution code, and in some cases comments explaining the logic.

## Goals
- Build strong fundamentals in DSA
- Solve problems consistently
- Revisit and improve older solutions
- Prepare for technical interviews

## How to Run
Most solutions are written in C++ and can be compiled using:
